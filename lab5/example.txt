A = [ [1, 2]]; # create 5x5 matrix filled with zeros

# transposition

D1 = A.+B' ; # add element-wise A with transpose of B
D2 = A.-B' ; # substract element-wise A with transpose of B
D3 = A.*B' ; # multiply element-wise A with transpose of B
D4 = A./B' ; # divide element-wise A with transpose of B
